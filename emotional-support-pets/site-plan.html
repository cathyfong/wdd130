      <h3>A New Beginning</h3>
      <p>
        Consider the possibility of adopting a new best friend! There are so many pets who are locked up in shelters looking for a new family. Oftentimes, we forget about ourselves and what we really want. We all want a caring friend who is always there for us. There are so many choices to choose from and endless possibilities!

      <h3>Why Adopt?</h3>
      <p>
        When you adopt a pet, you are saving a life. Animals that are not adopted in time, will be euthanized. If you adopt, you are giving another living animal another chance. Sometimes these pets are locked up their whole life in a cage, with little air and time to go outside for fresh air. Now imagine if that was you. You wouldn't like that! It is sad but it is the truth. Animals that are not adopted are forced into these conditions and have no way out. Some places that the pets are kept in are terrible. The conditions are dirty, they lack proper food and water sources, and the worst of all when these places are overcrowded. Depending on the situation of the shelter, these cute animals will be shoved into a cage with 3-4 other pets. These animals deserve a loving home with great people around them. And who would be better to adopt a pet? YOU!

      <h3>What are the benefits?</h3>
      <p>
        Oftentimes when we want a pet, we wonder what are the benefits. Pets provide us with love for our whole life. Nothing is better than coming home and seeing your pet at the door waiting for you. Pets have a lot of health benefits. They increase our opportunities to exercise, socialize, and help get our health back up. According to, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it is proven that playing with our pets can help decrease blood pressure, control cholesterol levels, and reduce triglycerides. Not only are they physically beneficial, they are also mentally beneficial. Studies prove dogs can reduce stress, give a better sense of purpose, and help you increase productivity.
